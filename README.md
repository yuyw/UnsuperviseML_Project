# Unsupervise Machine Learning Project
That is my project for course "Unsupervised Machine Learning" on Coursera Platform -- pca_lego.ipynb

Project
Optional: find your own data set
As a suggested first step, spend some time finding a data set that you are really passionate about. This can be a data set similar to the data you have available at work or data you have always wanted to analyze. For some people this will be sports data sets, while some other folks prefer to focus on data from a datathon or data for good.

Optional: participate in a discussion board
As an optional step, go into a discussion board and brainstorm with your peers great data sets to analyze. If you prefer to skip this step, feel free to use some of the data sets that were used throughout the course.

Required
Once you have selected a data set, you will produce the deliverables listed below and submit them to one of your peers for review. Treat this exercise as an opportunity to produce analysis that are ready to highlight your analytical skills for a senior audience, for example, the Chief Data Officer, or the Head of Analytics at your company.

Sections required in your report:

Main objective of the analysis that also specifies whether your model will be focused on clustering or dimensionality reduction and the benefits that your analysis brings to the business or stakeholders of this data.

Brief description of the data set you chose, a summary of its attributes, and an outline of what you are trying to accomplish with this analysis.

Brief summary of data exploration and actions taken for data cleaning orfeature engineering.

Summary of training at least three variations of the unsupervised model you selected. For example, you can use different clustering techniques or different hyperparameters.

A paragraph explaining which of your Unsupervised Learning models you recommend as a final model that best fits your needs in terms.

Summary Key Findings and Insights, which walks your reader through the main findings of your modeling exercise.

Suggestions for next steps in analyzing this data, which may include suggesting revisiting this model or adding specific data features to achieve a better model.

Here are frequently asked questions about the assignment and review process. Please read these before starting your assignment.

Do I have to come up with my own data set?

You are highly encouraged to find a data set you feel really passionate about. This will help you showcase analytical work that truly matches your skills. But if you prefer, you can use some of the data sets from this course.

Is it OK to choose the same data set as someone else?

Yes, more than one person can analyze the same data set. Most likely your insights will be different from your peers and you will still be able to showcase your own talent as a unique solution.

Do I have to train more than 3 different models?

It is highly recommended that you try at least three different models to highlight which tool or technique helped you address the main objective of your analysis.

Is this an individual assignment?

You can ask for help or assistance on technical issues and general direction of your analysis, but the interpretation of the analytical output and the writing of the report should be your own.

Examples of Good Feedback
As a reviewer, you will be required to provide feedback on the work of your peers.

When providing feedback, it is a good practice to first indicate what your peer did well on the assignment. After that, help your peer improve by providing specific, actionable advice.

Here are a few quotes of feedback collected from other learners who have taken this course before.

"It is great that you included plots of the main drivers of your clustering exercise. It really showcases the main differences from one cluster to another."

"On this particular clustering method, you might want to compare the results from the original data set vs. a set that does not have outliers. You might get better results".

"The comparison across your models could be more exhaustive. You can make it more evident why you selected this clustering method based on your business problem."

"You might want to use encoding for your categorical features. The current settings do not help you leverage any of your categorical features."

"There were no insights or key takeaways from your analysis. You already put in great work, but still needed to interpret your output a bit more to show stakeholders the value from your great analysis."

"If you feel really passionate about data related to the health crisis, your next step might be to merge it with data from this repository."
